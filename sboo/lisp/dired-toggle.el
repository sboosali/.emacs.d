;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Description:
;;
;; `dired-toggle' command could toggle to show dired buffer as a
;; sidebar for current directory(similar to `dired-sidebar', but more
;; lightweight). The sidebar buffer also enabled a minor mode named
;; `dired-toggle-mode', and it only contains one buffer instance,
;; change directories in it will not create news buffers.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; (use-package dired-toggle
;;   :defer t
;;   :bind (("<f3>" . #'dired-toggle)
;;          :map dired-mode-map
;;          ("q" . #'dired-toggle-quit)
;;          ([remap dired-find-file] . #'dired-toggle-find-file)
;;          ([remap dired-up-directory] . #'dired-toggle-up-directory)
;;          ("C-c C-u" . #'dired-toggle-up-directory))
;;   :config
;;   (setq dired-toggle-window-size 32)
;;   (setq dired-toggle-window-side 'left)

;;   ;; Optional, enable =visual-line-mode= for our narrow dired buffer:
;;   (add-hook 'dired-toggle-mode-hook
;;             (lambda () (interactive)
;;               (visual-line-mode 1)
;;               (setq-local visual-line-fringe-indicators '(nil right-curly-arrow))
;;               (setq-local word-wrap nil))))
