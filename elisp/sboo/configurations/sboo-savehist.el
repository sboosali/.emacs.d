;; NOTES
;;
;; `savehist` Persists arbitrary `read`able `elisp` variables.
;;
;; Values which can't be read back can't be saved and restored, but anything else could be persisted.
;; savehist doesn't care whether or not a variable "changes regularly", but if the variable doesn't contain a history of values then savehist isn't necessarily very useful -- savehist doesn't track the sequence of values of a variable over time; it just saves the current value of the variables it's interested in. Obviously that's fine for variables containing a list of historical values. For variables with a single changing value, you would just be remembering the most recent one of those (and any changes to that value which occurred between savehist saves wouldn't be noticed at all).
